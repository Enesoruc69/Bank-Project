# Banking Application

The **Banking Application** is a Java-based project that simulates core banking functionalities. It allows users to manage their accounts by performing operations such as depositing, withdrawing, transferring money, converting currency, and viewing account details. The application reads account data from a file and logs all transactions to another file for record-keeping.

## Features

- **Deposit Money**: Add funds to your account.
- **Withdraw Money**: Safely withdraw money from your account.
- **Money Transfer**: Transfer funds between accounts seamlessly.
- **Currency Conversion**: Convert between supported currencies (e.g., USD to EUR).
- **Account Information**: View account details, including balance and transaction history.
- **File Logging**: All transactions are logged in a separate file for tracking purposes.
- **File-Based Account Management**: Account information is read from a file at startup, ensuring data persistence.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language for implementing the application.
- **File I/O**: Used for reading account data and logging transactions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Ensures the application is modular and maintainable.
- **Exception Handling**: Handles potential errors like insufficient funds or invalid inputs gracefully.
